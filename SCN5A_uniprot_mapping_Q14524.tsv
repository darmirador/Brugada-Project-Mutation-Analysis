rs1805124	SCN5A	p.H558R	H558R	558	Q14524	Natural variant	channels properties are similar to wild-type; the double mutant R-558/I-512 channel shows that R-558 eliminates the negative shift induced by Ile-512 but only partially restores the kinetic abnormalities; can modulate the gating defects caused by Ala-2006 and other mutations; dbSNP:rs1805124	558-558
